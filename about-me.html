    <h2>Aggie Junior</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>Agnes Muturi</strong> allias <em>Aggie Junior</em>. Am 25 years old and a student at Moringa School. I study programming and software development.</p>
    <p>At the institution, i get to interract with many different people via our online meetings and learn from each individual. It can however be very challenging seeing that we're all from differet backgrounds and we reason differently. Here are some of the challenges we're currently facing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Poor internet connection</li>
        <li>Uncooperative students</li>
        <li>Power outages</li>
    </ul>
